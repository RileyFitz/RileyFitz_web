This is a simple repo to store the code powering my personal website.
It is a post based model to keep notes, code snippets, and tutorials that I have needed in the past, and probably the future.
However, it is only built to be used by a single user, and the admin page is used to login, and "unlock" the ability to make posts.

This repo is under an MIT license, so feel free to repurpose it for your own use. I simply ask that you give the repo a start. ðŸ˜‰
